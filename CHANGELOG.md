# DiceBear 8.0 - Release Notes

A major update with a small fix that changed the output of the avatars in some
cases. As soon as a fix changes the output of the avatars, we release a major
update to ensure that the avatars of a major version remain consistent. **This
update is backwards compatible and should not cause any issues.**

A bug with random backgrounds has been fixed. These were not consistent between
browsers due to their implementation. This problem has been fixed and the
backgrounds should now be calculated identically in all browsers.

Further information on this bug can be found in this issue:
