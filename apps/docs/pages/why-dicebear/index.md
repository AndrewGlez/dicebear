    gap: 20px;
    width: 100%;

  .why-dicebear-tools {
    margin: 32px 0 24px !important;
  }

One of the coolest aspects of DiceBear is the ability to create deterministic
avatars. This means you can generate the same avatar for every username or email
address - perfect for user profiles! Imagine how excited your users will be when
they see their customized avatars on your website or app. DiceBear makes it
possible - easy, super fast and a lot of fun!

## Many different avatar styles!

You can choose from 30 different avatar styles by fantastic artists. Here is
just a small sample.

## Easy to use

Integration into your platform is a breeze thanks to the available
[JavaScript library](/how-to-use/js-library/), [HTTP-API](/how-to-use/http-api/)
and even [Command-line API](/how-to-use/cli/).

### HTTP-API

Our <strong>free, fast and stable</strong> HTTP-API handles tens of millions of
requests daily. You can create SVG, PNG, JPEG, WebP, and AVIF avatars for your
projects without a subscription. And thanks to the global CDN of our sponsor
[bunny.net](https://bunny.net/), the avatars are just a hop, skip and a jump
away from your users.

Take a look at our [HTTP-API](/how-to-use/http-api/) documentation.

### JS-Library

Alternatively, you can use the [JavaScript library](/how-to-use/js-library/) and
[CLI](/how-to-use/cli/), which do not send any data to us. Also the JavaScript
library is very easy to use:

```js
import { createAvatar } from '@dicebear/core';
import { lorelei } from '@dicebear/collection';

let svg = createAvatar(lorelei, {
  seed: 'your-custom-seed',
  // any other options you want to add
}).toString();

console.log(svg); // Here is your unique SVG avatar!
```

Read more about the [JS library](/how-to-use/js-library/) and
[CLI](/how-to-use/cli/) in our documentation.

## Integration in React, Vue, Svelte, etc.

You can also use DiceBear with React, Vue, Svelte and similar without any
problems. Simply use our [HTTP-API](/how-to-use/http-api/) as an image source or
install the [JS-library](/how-to-use/js-library/) and use it as follows:

::: code-group

```jsx [react]
import { useMemo } from 'react';
import { createAvatar } from '@dicebear/core';
import { lorelei } from '@dicebear/collection';

function App() {
  const avatar = useMemo(() => {
    return createAvatar(lorelei, {
      size: 128,
      // ... other options
    }).toDataUri();
  }, []);

  return <img src={avatar} alt="Avatar" />;
}

export default App;
```

```vue [vue]
<script setup>
import { onMounted, ref } from 'vue';
import { createAvatar } from '@dicebear/core';
import { lorelei } from '@dicebear/collection';

const avatar = createAvatar(lorelei, {
  size: 128,
  // ... other options
}).toDataUri();
</script>

<template>
  <img :src="avatar" alt="Avatar" />
</template>
```

```svelte [svelte]
<script>
  import { createAvatar } from "@dicebear/core";
  import { lorelei } from "@dicebear/collection";

  let avatar = createAvatar(lorelei, {
    size: 128,
    // ... other options
  }).toDataUri();
</script>

<img src={avatar} alt="Avatar" />
```
